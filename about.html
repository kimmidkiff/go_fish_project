	A Little Bit About Us...
</h1>
<p>
Go Fish Bar & Grill has been servicing the Pinellas County area for over 15 years. We strive to get our seafood fresh from the Gulf, and we are always innovating, both in the kitchen and in the dining room, to give you an underwater experience you aren't soon to forget. Owner Kimberly Midkiff grew up in Pinellas County and has always had a deep love for the ocean, and would like to share that love with you.
